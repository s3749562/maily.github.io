          <h2>Team Profile</h2>
          <p>For the assignment 3, I wish to name my team the “Goal Diggers” as I believe this name is not only cool and funny, but also represents the enthusiasm and commitment of the team members towards the project. Therefore, this name could possibly attract the employer’s attention to learn more about my team as well as our project.</p>
          <p>Based on my test results, there are a number of qualifications and characteristics that my teammates should own in order to maximize our assignment’s success.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-13 pt-50 pt-lg-10 content" data-aos="fade-right">
            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>The eagerness to receive constructive criticism, fair-minded and highly committed are some of the important traits that should be possessed by my team members.  Since I was identified as an Assertive Defender (ISFJ-A) by the Myers-Briggs test, this personality type tends to continuously support and polish the other’s work due to their strong sense of perfectionism. Thus, working with people who are able handle my constructive suggestions will avoid conflicts and improve the project’s overall results as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Moreover, my teammates must be fair in task allocation as well as committed to their assigned deadlines. This is because in case there is an irresponsible member, I would be the volunteering one to finish all the tasks, due to my weakness which is overloading myself. However, this is a team project and if the paper is only done by one person, the performance will definitely be extremely low.</p>
            <p>Hence, having all 5 members to be supportive, fair-minded and committed will contribute immensely to the group’s success.</p>
            <h3>Learning styles</h3>
            <p>Team members who are able to learn best through visualizations and audio will be compatible with my learning styles results. By having the same habits of comprehending and processing information, it is easier for me and my teammates to understand each other’s opinions and discuss the knowledge in class, thereby increasing the productivity of the group.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it is also crucial to recruit members whose learning style is Kinesthetic. As half of this course is tutorial classes and we are required to create prototypes or artefacts in the next assignment, teammates who learn best through physical activities will make the group’s project more realistic and practical.
              Therefore, I would like my teammates to have all three learning styles for higher productivity as well as creating the most realistic project.</p>
            <h3>Creativity</h3>
            <p>Based on my creativity test results, it is my priority to find teammates who score higher on metrics that I am relatively low at, especially the Boldness and Connection. Thus, they will contribute to the group project in a different creative way that I am not able to contribute and eventually, enhance the creativity and the interesting aspects of our project. For example, those who have a high score of Boldness are more confident to push boundaries beyond the accepted conventions, in other words, create the most innovative IT projects that no one has ever thought of.</p>
            <p>To identify teammates that have all the qualifications and characteristics mentioned above, I would approach and observe my classmate’s behaviors in both lectures and tutorials and evaluate if they are suitable to collaborate with. Next, it is necessary to start communicating and ask for their test results to see if they actually possess all the mentioned factors, thus deciding my teammates.</p>
            <p>Generally, the results from three tests above show no conflicts and various connections to each other. For example, my strength of being good at managing a huge quantity of information in the creativity test, leads to my weakness which is overloading myself in the Myers-Briggs test. Additionally, my trait of being highly organized in the Myers-Briggs test is the result of the fact that I learn best through charts and graphs from the learning style test. </p>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>My IT Project idea is developing a stock prediction system. Particularly, the system will gather, update and analyse the text of the related online news, then evaluate and make predictions on what stocks would drop or rise in what degree, by utilizing the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.</p>
          <p>This stock prediction system is considered as a stock adviser that provides investors more information and analysis, leading to the most secure and profitable decisions. Furthermore, the system reduces the amount of time comprehending and keeping up with the news which has a huge impact on the stock prices.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the system could be launched as a mobile application and a website, allowing investors to access the system whenever and wherever they want.</p>
          
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>According to Hong (2020), up to 90% of the investors lose their money on the stock market. The top reasons are that people are not conducting enough online research; and diversify their portfolio with different industries and categories (Kunsman 2019).</p>
          <h4><li>Investors don't have enough time and knowledge to analyse online news</li></h4>
          <p>To invest in different industries or categories, Investors must deeply understand the characteristics of not only the company they are investing in, but also the overall industry. This includes interpreting the financial reports, keeping track of the stock chart and reading online news related to the company. Thus, it requires a large amount of time and manual analysis to invest in different companies.</p>
          <p>Once the online research has been conducted, it is still extremely time-consuming and costly to correctly evaluate how the piece of news would affect the stock prices. Due to the fact that the investors do not have experience or knowledge in an industry, they must spend time learning or hire an expert if they want to invest in such an industry.</p>
          <h4><li>News affects stock prices</li></h4>
          <p>Negative news such as bad rumors, political uncertainty and lapse in corporate governance cause people to sell stocks and decreases in prices, meanwhile, positive news like new product launch, corporate acquisitions and positive economy translate into buying pressure and increases in stock prices (Beers 2020). From that, reading and keeping up with the news online is one of the important tasks that informs investors to sell or buy stocks at the right time.</p>
          <p>The lack of time and knowledge for online research, together with the huge impact of online news and journals to stock prices, the majority of investors are not able to generate enough revenue from the stock market. Therefore, my stock prediction system will reduce the workload, save time and money, as well as provide the best analysis and advice for investors to decide; by analyzing online documents for them.</p>

          <h3>Description</h3> 
          <h4><li>Gather, update and select the appropriate pieces of online news</li></h4>
          <p>Utilizing the techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system will identify and understand pieces of online news and journals around the world that contain relevant keywords and phrases which might affect the stock prices. If the content language is foreign, the system could also translate it into Vietnamese.</p>
          <p>The system will collaborate and be linked with global online newspapers and journalism brands such as Viet Nam News, Tuoi Tre News, Forbes and The New York Times, in order to showcase the most up-to-date and related news.</p>
          <p>For example, when an online article is released in Tuoi Tre News, the system will skim the texts and see if words and phrases like “drinks”, “Coca Cola”, “revenue declines” and “customers stop drinking” appear multiple times in the appropriate context. It will automatically understand that this piece of news is relevant to investors and could possibly affect the stock prices of Coca Cola company, the carbonated drinks category as well as the FMCG industry. Thus, showcasing such pieces of news on the platforms of the system for the investors to read.</p>
          <h4><li>Give predictions on what and how stocks will behave</li></h4>
          <p>The texts of the online newspapers and journals will be analyzed and compared with its data and learning experience, then make detailed predictions about what stocks will go up or down at what degree and at what time, using the Machine Learning techniques. Thus, advise investors to act immediately. This feature could be continuously improved by allowing the system users and developers to provide feedback. This is because the more data it has, the higher accuracy of the predictions.</p>
          <p>For instance, taking the mentioned example, after the relevant online article has been identified, the system would conclude that “Coca Cola company’s stock price is expected to significantly drop due to declining customer demand. Conversely, this could be an opportunity for its competitors like Pepsi to lead the market. Thus, investors should sell Coca Cola’s stock and buy Pepsi’s stock.”. The reason why the system is able to perform this prediction is because it has been “taught” that, if the words like “Coca Cola” and “customer stop drinking” appear in the same text, the outcome would be a decline in Coca Cola’s stock price; or the system has received many negative feedbacks when it says the stock price would increase, so it learned from past mistakes.</p>
          <p>However, this is just a very simple circumstance in which the investors could interpret the article themselves. In other complicated situations when the investors do not acquire the knowledge in a specific industry or category, this is when this system solves the problem.</p>
          <p>For example, when investors see an article that contains words like “oil company”, “loss”, “negative cash flow”, they could misunderstand that this oil company is in trouble and going to bankrupt and sell stocks immediately. Contrastly, experts in such an industry consider this article as an opportunity to buy stocks. This is because they understand the unique characteristics of the oil industry is that companies must invest in repairing and buying new equipment periodically, which costs a lot of money and completely normal, consequently, the temporary loss in revenue and the potential profit in the future.</p>
          <p>Therefore, my system works with experts in various industries as well as receives feedback from the knowledgeable users, to feed the system relevant knowledge and data to increase the prediction accuracy.</p>

          <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
          <p>There is no doubt that physical computer resources such as the screen, keyboard, mouse, monitor and memory device are required. For projects that involve intensive machine learning algorithms like this stock prediction system, one hardware requirement is a reasonably powerful GPU like the Nvidia GTX 1080 which can train an average of 14,000 examples per second (Singh 2019).</p>
          <p>Furthermore, a software to write code like Visual Studio Code is needed to develop the system. As it requires a heavy manual coding job to be successful, developers should also use tools like GitHub to co-develop the system in a large group.</p>

          <h3>Skills required</h3>
          <p>According to Chakraborty (2016), computer science and programming, mathematics and statistics, data science and problem solving are the most important skills that machine learning engineers should possess. On the other hand, NLP engineers are required to have strong communication skills, text classification and clustering skills as well as a good understanding of text representation techniques, algorithms and statistics, in order to be successful (Campana 2020). As these two areas have been applied for a long time and in a large number of innovations, I believe it is relatively easy to find enough qualified human resources who are able to satisfy the mentioned skills.</p>
          <p>In contrast, being able to recruit all industry experts which are the core human resources of this stock prediction project, is not relatively feasible. The reason is that in order to reach all experts in every industry, it would be very money-consuming and requires extremely wide social networking.</p>

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>If this stock prediction system releases and achieve big success, there are 2 potential outcomes, namely:</p>
          <h4><li>More time on other investing activities</li></h4>
          <p>Since the project provides accurate predictions and becomes successful, investors spend less time or even no longer have to read online newspapers and journals. Therefore, reduce the manual analysis and allow them to have more time focusing on other tasks like reading financial reports and keeping track of the stock charts, which will further strengthen their investment decisions.</p>
          <h4><li>Too dependent on the system</li></h4>
          <p>At the end of the day, this system only gives predictions which are not 100% accurate. If the project succeeds, some users might possibly depend on the system to make investment decisions and overlook other activities. This could cause a backlash for the project.</p>

            <h3 class="resume-title">Feedback 1</h3>
            <div class="resume-item pb-0">
              <h4>Quote</h4>
              <p>"Your project is very helpful</p>
              <p>As an Economic and Finance student, it is already extremely difficult for professionals to make correct predictions on the stock market, even though you have a good understanding of statistics and probabilities. This is because of one unique characteristic of the stock market, which is that past performances reflect almost no guarantee of future results. Hence, there is no success in training machines to predict stock prices, through stocks charts and financial reports.</p>
              <p>Contrastly, analyzing online documents like news and journals are something that machines could make predictions from, as long as it has enough data. Because the only problem that humans are not able to do is that there is so much news to catch up, and they do not acquire relevant knowledge to make predictions, which are something machines could do. Therefore, I believe your project could make a big impact in helping investors in small tasks.</p>
              <p>However, keep in mind that reading online documents should not be the only aspect that investors consider. Your system might not give the most accurate forecast based on only online news and journals. What is more, due to the fact that news affects stock prices so fast, the changes in stock prices could just be temporary. From that, investors could lose a lot of opportunities if they follow your system, but the stock price trend changes its direction again, the next day.”</p>
              
              <h4>My discussion</h4>
              <p>In my perspective, this feedback is extremely useful and critical and I totally agree, especially when it comes from an Economic and Finance student. The feedback also clearly provides what points from my project is good and what points from my project is bad, which does not make me feel like I am being criticized at all.</p>
              <p>Also, there is various evidence that proves the authenticity of the feedback. According to Brown (2016), investors should not base their expectations of future results on past performance before they invest. Moreover, as the markets digest new information very quickly, investors should protect themselves from short-term stock market volatilities (BMO 2020).</p>
              <p>Regarding my actions, there are two features I would add to my project to prevent investors from losing profit as much as possible, based on the feedback. Firstly, continuously provide a warning that investors should also analyse other factors like the company’s financial report and the stock charts, throughout their experience using the system. Secondly, strengthen the algorithms for the machines to be able to identify temporary stock price changes, thus offering better advice.</p>

            <div class="resume-item">
              <h4>Quote</h4>
              <p>“The idea is good and persuasive with a good use of AI technologies. However, I believe it is extremely difficult to actually build this project because of the intensive workload. Plus, contacting experts from all industries seems impossible.”</p>
              <h4>My discussion</h4>
              <p>I agree with this feedback. Although this feedback is constructive as it stated the exact major challenge in building the system, it is not really useful because I am already able to identify it myself, in the “Skills required” part.</p>
              <p>As for my utilization of the feedback, making as much as connections during the time studying in RMIT University and working in the future, is one action I could take to reach experts in numerous industries if I want to execute this project.</p>

          <h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
          <h4>What does it do?</h4>
          <p>NLP refers to a form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to read, comprehend and interpret the appropriate meanings of human language (Poelmans 2020). In particular, NLP works by breaking down the language into shorter words and phrases, then recognizing the rules, relationships and patterns between them; thus creating the meanings (Anirudh 2020). The basic tasks of NLP includes part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, tokenization, disambiguation, and semantics (Poelmans 2020). Moreover, since the text- and voice-based data from human language is extremely complex and diverse, NLP requires many techniques from statistical and machine learning to rules-based and algorithmic approaches, to interpret (Poelmans 2020).</p>
          <p>In the present day, there are a large number of NLP applications that we are using in our daily life, namely:</p>
          <li>Machine translation: automatic translation of text or speech from one language to another (Google Translate).</li>
          <li>Spell checking: recognizes spelling errors in the content and suggests it with a correct spelling (Grammarly, Microsoft Word and Google Docs).</li>
          <li>Sentiment analysis: identify if the text shows negative or positive opinions, broadly used in Marketing to measure customer satisfaction (KeyHole and Brand 24).</li>
          <li>Question replying:  answers the questions raised by humans in both text and verbal (chatbots, Siri, Alexa and OK Google).</li>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to Anirudh (2020), NLP is expected to be more user-oriented in the future, due to the growth of technologies. Specifically, NLP applications will not just be restricted to resolve customer questions, but will also be able to provide greater technological help. For example, if someone asks NLP, “What is wrong with my network?”, it will not only be able to explain the problem, but also be aware of the user’s actual intention which is that he wants to access the network immediately.</p>

          <h4>What is likely the impact?</h4>
          <p>Potentially, NLP will be more and more useful for our lives, most importantly in terms of social. It changes the ways we communicate to achieve what we want because we no longer need another person or do things. Now, it can be easily seen that everyone talks to their Siri or Google to get tasks done or questions answered. Plus, virtual assistants and chatbots are able to do much more effective tasks than humans. Hence, allowing NLP users to have a more convenient life as well as a more productive business. This innovation is currently and expected to keep replacing people working in customer services and sales, such as salespeople in the next 20 years (King 2016).</p>

          <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
          <p>As a Digital Marketing student, it is crucial for me to keep learning and researching about NLP applications in the marketing industry and how it can help marketers to be more effective in their jobs, in order to achieve my desirable career goals.</p>
          <p>Regarding my family, although some NLP applications are not optimized in the Vietnamese language, my parents and siblings who don’t speak English might have chances to interact with this popular technique for a more convenient lifestyle in the future, due to its rapid development.</p>

          <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
          <h4>What does it do?</h4>
          <p>Machine Learning (ML) is defined as an application of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being programmed to do so (Expert System Team 2020). Particularly, the learning process starts with observations or data such as examples, direct experience or instruction, in order to recognize patterns in data and make the most accurate predictions in the future (Expert System Team 2020). Additionally, the base of Machine Learning is computational mathematics and statistics (Pioneer Labs n.d.).</p>
          <p>There are three types of machine learning algorithms, namely (Pioneer Labs n.d.):</p>
          <li>Supervised learning</li>
          <p>After being provided with a number of input variables (x) and output variables (y), the machine will be able to make predictions about the output for any new given inputs. The most common examples are Linear regression and Nearest Neighbours.</p>
          <li>Unsupervised learning</li>
          <p>Provide the machine with input variables (x) but no output variables (y), to discover the underlying structure or distribution of data and help users make decisions. Some of the examples are the Apriori algorithm and k-means.</p>
          <li>Reinforcement learning</li>
          <p>The machine learns and trains itself continuously by receiving a positive or a negative feedback based on its actions. Some popular examples include Q-Learning and Temporal Difference.</p>
          <p>Today, Machine Learning has been applied in various tasks which helps us to make better decisions and process information faster. For instance, face detection, movies or product recommendation, fraud detection, predictions and so much more.</p>
          <p>In the future, the field of Machine Learning is likely to enhance its personalization aspects as well as increase the use of robots (Rose 2020). Firstly, by being able to satisfy customers with personalized experience, many businesses are aiming to improve personalization through ML techniques. Secondly, since robots perform tasks much faster and more accurate by ML algorithms, more businesses are adopting robots to increase productivity.</p>

          <h4>What is likely the impact?</h4>
          <p>Thanks to Machine Learning, human life could be positively impacted in a large number of ways in the future. For example, although self-driving cars still require at least one driver for safety, it is possible that we will have completely automated cars using the fundamentals of ML (Elite n.d.). This innovation promises a range of potential benefits for car users including, higher road safety (drunk people still able to use the car), increase independence (disable people or the elders still can use the car), more productivity (you could read the emails while the car drives itself) and environment-friendly (reduce fuel consumption). However, people working in transportation services like taxi drivers or delivery guys could potentially lose their jobs due to this potential product.</p>

          <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
          <p>When ML is combined with NLP, it could create an extremely powerful machine that leverages the success marketing strategies. Thereby, Machine Learning is also one of the techniques that I should pay attention to and learn more, to improve my knowledge and skills for my future career path.</p>

        <p>For this part, I chose to interview my close friend who is a freelance data scientist and mobile app developer, specialising in iOS development. His name is Nguyen Khac Hao and he is desiring to build his own start-up company.</p>
        <p>For most of his typical days, he tries to design the best optimizing algorithms for better models, conduct research on convex optimization and generative adversarial networks, then test and run the code. In terms of developing apps, besides coding, Hao also conducts market research to see what his target users want and who are the competitors, in order to increase the competitiveness of his app.</p>
        <p>It is important for Hao to keep in touch with his clients regularly to check up on the progress as well as constantly co-working with other data scientists. Moreover, negotiating with investors is one of the necessary tasks to seek funding for his own app.</p>
        <p>As a freelancer, Hao spends most of his time coding at home. He also indicated that since programming is all about problem solving, brainstorming how to debug and design the best code is the most challenging part in his job.</p>
